  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in backend development,
    machine learning, and data structures. I enjoy designing efficient, scalable, and secure
    applications that address real-world challenges through practical and well-structured solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have hands-on experience working with modern backend technologies, building RESTful systems,
    and developing data-driven machine learning models for analysis and prediction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside development, I actively strengthen my problem-solving skills through continuous
    practice of data structures and algorithms, while exploring emerging technologies such as
    Generative AI. My goal is to grow as a software engineer by continuously learning, applying
    best practices, and contributing to impactful and innovative work.
